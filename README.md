================

since all of the good manga readers were taken off of google play, decided to make a script to sit on my personal server to create cbr files. I know this script is a dime a dozen if you search for manga on github, but I wanted something I can set to run once a week or so and not worry about needing to make sure my stuff is ready. Much of the code is going to be tailored to my server so you may have to change a line or 2 to use it, or I may after it is working make the locations part of the config file.  I'll worry about that once I have a working script.

I chose to use -eatmanga- (I switched to goodmanga until i can figure out what eatmanga's "too fast, i think your DDOSing me" policy is) as the source, only cause their directory layout was the easiest to follow.  You could in theory use any source. I'm also adding a "config" file so that you can tell the script what to download and set it to a cron job. I read the comics on my tablet alot so I'm pairing it with [Syncronize Ultimate] so I can have a symbitotic relationship and not deal with laggy sites while I'm on the train and whatnot.
